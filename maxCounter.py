## You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them increase(X) âˆ’ counter X is increased by 1,
## max counter âˆ’ all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
## A non-empty zero-indexed array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:
## 
## if A[K] = X, such that 1 â‰¤ X â‰¤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
## if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.
## For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:
## 
##     A[0] = 3
##     A[1] = 4
##     A[2] = 4
##     A[3] = 6
##     A[4] = 1
##     A[5] = 4
##     A[6] = 4
## the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:
## 
##     (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
##     (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
##     (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
##     (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
##     (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
##     (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
##     (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)
## The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.
## 
## Write a function:
## 
## def solution(N, A)
## 
## that, given an integer N and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.
## 
## The sequence should be returned as:
## 
## a structure Results (in C), or
## a vector of integers (in C++), or
## a record Results (in Pascal), or
## an array of integers (in any other programming language).
## For example, given:
## 
##     A[0] = 3
##     A[1] = 4
##     A[2] = 4
##     A[3] = 6
##     A[4] = 1
##     A[5] = 4
##     A[6] = 4
## the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.
## 
## Assume that:
## 
## N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
## each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].
## Complexity:
## 
## expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);
## expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
## Elements of input arrays can be modified.
